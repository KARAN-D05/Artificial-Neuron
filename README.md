# 🧠 Artificial-Neuron
- This project implements a basic artificial neuron (McCulloch–Pitts model) using `Verilog HDL`. The current version consists of a simple 2-input neuron node that sums binary inputs and produces an output based on  a programmable threshold. With different threshold values, the neuron can emulate basic logic functions such as AND and OR.
